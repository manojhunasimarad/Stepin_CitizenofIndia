## Introduction:-
India is the largest democratic country in the world. It firmly believes Unity in diversity. Hence there are various factors affecting us directly or indirectly like population, education environment etc. Therefore digitalization has a large impact on us. We the people of India have the right to elect our own representatives.This projects will demonstrate the management of ELection Commission of India to Add, Delete, Modify and can store all the data permanently or temporarily of all the constituents of India that is voters. Also in this project we have successfully used our understanding of c program to implement it.



## Objectives:
The main objectives of this project are 
--successful enrollment of citizens of India in voters list id which can use operations like add, delete, view, search, and modify user database.
--to illustrate the digitalization done in file storage process eliminating hand written and hardcover documents.
--to achieve success in using my understandings of c program to implement it.




## Features :
--We can add member in voter ID database. 

--we can edit member in voter ID database.

--we can modify member in voter ID database like
--------due to change of address. 
--------due to change of name.

--we can opt to display the data. 

--we can view the Voters data.


The upcoming *features* would be like 

=>two step autentication

=>biometric scan 

=>GPS location tracking 

=>smart Card and many more




## Research
https://www.nvsp.in/

from the website, the latest elections has been done and with all the copyrights, i have implemented the database management system


## Cost and Features and Timeline
Cost is initially low because all you need is a operating sytem and our application in which it can be executed easily.
It could be initially used in university or college to elect their student secretary or president.


## Defining Our System
    This System is used to store view and search USer mainly the voters, depending on the contex.
    
    
## SWOT ANALYSIS
![SWOT-Sample](Link to Pic)

## strengths 
a primary focus on quality improvement internal team dedicated to research and analytics high quality of authorities modern computers operating systems or devices well-equipped

## Weaknesses 
output devices and facilities and technologies insufficient management lack of funding and resources our locations that are not easily accessible for anyone in the quantity and saw the authority's hai staff turnovers
## Threats 
economy or political in security policy and legislation changes that result in budget deficits are preserved to reduce cost while meeting expectation of universal coverages increased competency


## Opportunities 

this data can be used for organising managing the data knowledge share deploying various schemes related to health economy and social initiatives could be driven by engaging increase of fund analytics research including both staff technology create member programs
# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

**All the election commission authorities or members**

## What:

**colleges or universities trying to marriage elect a student secretaries can also implement this idea. Conclusion and implementation produces management of constituent's along with a data to add, modify, search,view or delete operations**

what **

## Where:

**In authorised centre  the authorities can use application on desktop**

## How:

**implementation will be done in GitHub using c code for the project purpose where as in the real life by physical or online ,the Voter or the user can feed the data his/her laptop raising a request for authorities to approve or reject.The system creates an external file to store the data eminently and this is done using the knowledge of C programming and operating systems**

# Detail requirements
## High Level Requirements:

-- ID | Description | Status (Implemented/Future)


hr01 customers can add details of the constituencies voters
hr02 Customers can delete 
hr03 update 
hr04 search 
hr05 biometric scan 
hr06 smart card 
hr07 GPS tracking




HR01|Description | Status (Implemented/Future)|
HR01|Description | Status (Implemented/Future)|
HR01|Description | Status (Implemented/Future)|
HR01|Description | Status (Implemented/Future)|



##  Low level Requirements:

Low level requirements 2018 system should provide check whether the Voter is in list or not 0

LR02 the system should be able to add the user data who is not in list 

LR03 system should be able to delete ,update , view and search the voters who are in the list only.



security concerns this should be used by only authorised user and they can admitted to the system|
platform is about the system working on any operating system be it windows or Linux|
performance of a man should handle the large amount of constituent state
--- TBD in Tabular Format 
-- ID | Description | Status (Implemented/Future)
