=>two step autentication
=>biometric scan 
=>GPS location tracking 
=>smart Card and many more


## Research
https://www.nvsp.in/
from the website, the latest elections has been done and with all the copyrights, i have implemented the database management system

## Cost and Features and Timeline
Cost is initially low because all you need is a operating sytem and our application in which it can be executed easily.
It could be initially used in university or college to elect their student secretary or president.


## Defining Our System
    This System is used to store view and search USer mainly the voters, depending on the contex.

## SWOT ANALYSIS
![SWOT-Sample](Link to Pic)

## strengths 
a primary focus on quality improvement internal team dedicated to research and analytics high quality of authorities modern computers operating systems or devices well-equipped

## Weaknesses 
output devices and facilities and technologies insufficient management lack of funding and resources our locations that are not easily accessible for anyone in the quantity and saw the authority's hai staff turnovers
## Threats 
economy or political in security policy and legislation changes that result in budget deficits are preserved to reduce cost while meeting expectation of universal coverages increased competency


## Opportunities 

this data can be used for organising managing the data knowledge share deploying various schemes related to health economy and social initiatives could be driven by engaging increase of fund analytics research including both staff technology create member programs
# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

**TBD**

## What:

**TBD**

## When:

**TBD**

## Where:

**TBD**

## How:

**The system creates an external file to store the data eminently and this is done using the knowledge of C programming and operating systems**

# Detail requirements
## High Level Requirements:

##  Low level Requirements:

Low level requirements 2018 system should provide check whether the Voter is in list or not 0

LR02 the system should be able to add the user data who is not in list 

LR03 system should be able to delete ,update , view and search the voters who are in the list only.



security concerns this should be used by only authorised user and they can admitted to the system|
platform is about the system working on any operating system be it windows or Linux|
performance of a man should handle the large amount of constituent state
